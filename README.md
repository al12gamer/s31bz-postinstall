# s31bz-postinstall
Universal script to run on Pop, Fedora or Arch, post-install, for my systems.
In the future, when testing compatibility, I'll add scripts for more systems.

## Prep
The scripts that will be run by the main start menu will require ansible in the future. This has not yet been implemented
See [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for more information how to install ansible for your distro.
## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/s31bz-postinstall.git
cd s31bz-postinstall
chmod +x start.sh
bash start.sh
```
